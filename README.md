Interital Navigation System AUV using VN100 IMU, Depth sensor and Cameras.
Groudn truth data collection done on ground robot using wheel encoders and overhead camera tracking.
IMU is trained with Recurrent Neural Networks to reduce sensor drift.
Camera and IMU data is fused using Inertial Navigation system algorithm to use in a known environment.
Ideal for situations where GPS is unavailable.
